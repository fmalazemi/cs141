| 4          | 1         | Not Perfect Number |

### Problem 5: All Perfect Numbers up to `n`
A perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). Write a program that takes an integer `n` and outputs all perfect numbers up to `n`.

| Test Cases | **Input** | **Output**               |
|------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| 1          | 9         | 6                        |

### Problem 7: Quadratic Equation
Write a program that solves a quadratic equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` where `b*b >= 4*a*c`. 
Your program reads three positive integers `a, b, c` and prints all possible roots of `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`.
